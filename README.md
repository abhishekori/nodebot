# Chat Bot :speech_balloon:

## This is small and really simple chat bot built in node and socket io

# Cool thing? :sunglasses:
## Well it uses <a href="https://libraries.io/npm/speakeasy-nlp">Speak easy nlp</a> library to recognise weather the contents of the chat which the user has sent is of negative or positive in nature. 

## If you abuse :angry:,it will reply back with what ever you have abused back. If you complement :relaxed: it really appreciate you :kissing_heart:
